# TeddyCom

This command-line interface Ruby app is a one-way Twilio sms broadcast system for conferences or large events. Utilizing the Google Sheets API to use Google Sheets as the primary database of phone numbers, database accessibility becomes a breeze for small-medium organizations who already use Google Sheets for registration purposes.
